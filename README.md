    cd PrimarySchoolExamPapers
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

### Building for Production

To build the application for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `.output` directory.

To generate a static site (SSG):

```bash
npm run generate
```

The output will be in the `.output/public` directory.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`app/app.vue`**: The main application component containing the UI logic and template.
- **`public/`**: Static assets served directly.
    - **`files/`**: Contains the PDF exam papers.
    - **`json/`**: Contains the data files (`files.json` and `dropdownOptions.json`).
- **`nuxt.config.ts`**: Nuxt configuration file.

## 📄 Data Management

The application uses two JSON files in `public/json/` to manage data:

1.  **`files.json`**: A list of all available PDF filenames (e.g., `4_7102_3_1_2023`).
2.  **`dropdownOptions.json`**: Mappings for the codes used in filenames (e.g., mapping `7102` to "Catholic High School").

To add new papers, simply upload the PDF to `public/files/` and update `public/json/files.json` with the new filename.
